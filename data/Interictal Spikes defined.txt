The term epileptiform is used to connote EEG patterns believed to be associated with a relatively high risk for having seizures. Gloor [43] defined spikes as potentials that stand above the background, have a “pointy” shape, duration between 30 and 70–80 ms, asymmetric rise and fall, and followed by a slow wave. The potential should have a sensible field, meaning that it should be reflected in physically adjacent electrodes and perhaps in synaptically linked regions such as the contralateral hemisphere. “Sharp waves” have durations of 70–200 ms. The distinction between spikes and sharp waves is arbitrary in the clinical arena and is discussed further below (see also [28]).
